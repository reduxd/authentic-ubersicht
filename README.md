## Installation
1. Download [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/)
2. Copy `authentic.widget` to your widgets folder.
3. Add your [OpenWeatherMap API key](https://openweathermap.org/api) to `authentic.coffee`.

## Advanced

### Setting the Units
Celsius and Fahrenheit units are provided in the widget. To adjust this, change the value of `unit` in `authentic.coffee`.

### Setting the Icon Set
Three icon sets are provided with the widget: white, black, and blue. To adjust this, change the value of `icon` in `authentic.coffee`.

### Setting the Snippet
The widget above the phrase can be changed between an icon, the temperature, or both. To adjust this, change the value of `showIcon` and `showTemp` in `authentic.coffee`.

### Setting the Refresh Rate
By default, the widget will get new data every 5 minutes. To adjust this, change the value of `rate` in `authentic.coffee`. The value should be in milliseconds, so multiply the number of seconds by 1000. Note that forecast.io has a limit on how frequently you can send requests.
